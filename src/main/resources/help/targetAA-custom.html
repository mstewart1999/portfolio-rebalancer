  <h1>pBalancer Target Asset Allocation: Custom</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Defining a target asset allocation provides structure for your portfolio
      and helps to control the level of risk and reward.  You can expect
      that taking more risk <b>MAY</b> lead to more reward over long time horizons,
      but <b>WILL</b> lead to more volatility over short time horizons.  However,
      in investing there are no guarantees, even over very long time periods,
      so beware.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should periodically evaluate your portfolio's <b>current</b>
      asset allocation and its deviation from your target.  Rebalancing at least
      once a year is recommended in order to bring the level of risk back to
      your target level, although some people choose not to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      An asset allocation consists of one or more <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp">asset classes</a>
      in a fixed ratio. pBalancer allows you to define a hierarchy or grouping
      mechanism for defining the split between asset classes, although you can
      simply define everything in a single group if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      pBalancer defines a few major asset classes:
      <ul>
        <li>Stocks (equity) - denoted as "EQ".<br>
            Equity investments are best thought of as ownership of corporations.
            They are the riskiest, but have the highest potential for reward.
        <li>Bonds (fixed income) - denoted as "FI".<br>
            Fixed income covers a variety of situations, but can be thought of as
            a loan (to a government or corporation) with cashflows
            defined by a contract.  Bonds are usually less risky than stocks,
            and as an investor, you can expect to be compensated less as a result.
        <li>Cash (considered a sub type of fixed income) - denoted as "FI-CASH".<br>
            Most cash investments have virtually no risk to your principal,
            except in extreme situations, but they also pay very little interest.
            Beware of the risk of inflation.
        <li>Various alternative investments - categorized under "OTH"<br>
            These investments are somewhat out of the mainstream, so approach
            with caution.  They include things like real estate, or commodities
            such as gold.
      </ul>
      Within each major asset class, there are a variety of sub asset classes.
      In some cases these are very broad ("EQ-US-TSM": US total stock market),
      and in others they are diced very finely ("EQ-US-SV": US small cap value stocks)
      in order to provide flexibility for you to define your asset allocation
      at the desired level of granularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be aware that asset classes at any level of granularity can be invested
      in a single asset (a stock, bond, mutual fund, or ETF) or multiple - in
      which case the assets will be aggregated in the "Current Asset Allocation"
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      pBalancer provides some guidance for choosing among the predefined lazy
      portfolios, but with a custom asset allocation, you are largely on your own.
    </p>

    <h2>Editing Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
      You can start with any of the Predefined Lazy Portfolios and then
      customize them, or <strong>Reset</strong> to a completely blank state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select any row of the table and then perform an editing action:
      <ul>
        <li>Double click on the <strong>% of parent</strong> column to adjust
            the percent. You can enter the value as a decimal like "0.5" for 50%,
            an explicit percent like "50%", or an expression like you might enter
            in a spreadsheet like "=1/3" which might be helpful for representing
            exact ratios.<br>
            Validation checks will be performed before you can save.
        <li><strong>+ Group</strong>: add a grouping node as a child of an
            existing group.  You will be prompted for a name, and the percent
            will default to 0%.
        <li><strong>+ Asset</strong>: add a grouping node as a child of an
            existing group.  You will be prompted to select an asset class, 
            and the percent will default to 0%.
        <li><strong>Up</strong>: rearrange children with a group
        <li><strong>Down</strong>: rearrange children with a group
        <li><strong>Delete</strong>: remove child group or asset and all
            of its children.  No undo!
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Nested vs Flat</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Nested</strong> tab allows viewing and editing of the
      asset allocation with full representation of the hierarchy of grouping.
      The percentage values in this view represent the proportion relative
      to the immediate parent group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Flat</strong> tab allows viewing of all asset classes
      and their computed proportion relative to the entire portfolio,
      but omits all of the grouping information.<br>
      No editing is allowed in this view.
