  <h1>pBalancer Target Asset Allocation: Predefined Lazy Portfolios</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Defining a target asset allocation provides structure for your portfolio
      and helps to control the level of risk and reward.  You can expect
      that taking more risk <b>MAY</b> lead to more reward over long time horizons,
      but <b>WILL</b> lead to more volatility over short time horizons.  However,
      in investing there are no guarantees, even over very long time periods,
      so beware.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should periodically evaluate your portfolio's <b>current</b>
      asset allocation and its deviation from your target.  Rebalancing at least
      once a year is recommended in order to bring the level of risk back to
      your target level, although some people choose not to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing a predefined asset allocation allows you the benefit of expert
      advice while maintaining your portfolio in a DIY manner. Choosing amongst
      the many options, however, is difficult if you do not have investment
      expertise yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a complete beginner, I suggest you read the resources section.
      The "Three Fund Portfolio (60/40)" is appropriate for many investors - 
      regardless of your sophistication, investment knowledge, and asset level.
      Although it is recommended that you customize the EQ/FI ratio to your
      preferred risk level.

      That site has compiled them from a variety of sources and includes
